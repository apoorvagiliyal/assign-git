What does fast-forward in Git mean?

Merging or rebasing against a branch that is simply ahead
of the one you checked out, is when Git performs a fast-forward.
"Fast forwarding" in Git refers to updating the HEAD pointer so
that its new value is a direct descendant of the previous value.

Why should you have different branches?
It allows developers to branch out from the main code base and
separate their work from other developers using branching. Multiple developers can remotely work on the project using the different branches It also
makes it easier for Git to combine versions later on.

In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually
have?
You can have as many remote Git repositories as you wish, but only one
designated "origin" branch is allowed. The "origin" remote is the default
remote that Git creates when you clone an existing repository.
